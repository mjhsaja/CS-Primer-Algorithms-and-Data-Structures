# CS Primer Algorithms and Data Structures

Algorithms and Data Structures can be a particular rewarding area of study, because it drives at the core of computer programming: solving difficult problems.

In the course below, you’ll learn a number of important data structures and algorithms, which we’re sure will prove useful throughout your career. Just as importantly, you’ll develop a stronger ability to understand, break down and solve novel problems, whether inventing your own techniques or repurposing those which you learn here.

At the core of this course are the sequences of problems for each topic. You should aim to solve each problem, using the worked solutions and supplementary explainers as needed. For more suggestions on how to approach CS Primer, see the [how-to guide](https://csprimer.com/how/).

Also included are seminars recorded with CS Primer students, which you may like to work through as well, by stopping and asking yourself each of the questions we cover together. These were typically recorded after the students completed 1-2 problems in that module, so are designed to reinforce the fundamental concepts and prepare for harder problems.

As a supplementary resources, I recommend Steven Skiena’s [video lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOtl7M3yp-DXbHTFe_w9zFPXeau28CDao) and book: [The Algorithm Design Manual](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Computer-Science-dp-3030542556/dp/3030542556/). This tends to be a little less heavy in theory, and has a more "problem solving" orientation than the typically recommended textbooks. There are plenty of other good resources available online, such as those from Tim Roughgarden. Generally I suggest just attempting the problems below, and reaching for the textbook if you feel conceptually stuck or would like further practice problems.
